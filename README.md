# workout-tracker
This is a project for my Software Engineering I class.

This workout tracker allows a user to log their workouts, tracking their lifts with sets, reps, RPE (rate of perceived exertion).

The tracker has functionality for viewing exercise demonstration videos, suggesting going up in weight (progressive overload) based on RPE tracking.
